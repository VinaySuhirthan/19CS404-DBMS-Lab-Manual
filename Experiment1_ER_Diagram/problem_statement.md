# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.

- A bill is generated per reservation, and handled by a specific waiter.
- Cardinality is mostly one-to-many from customer to reservation/orders, and many-to-many from orders to dishes.
- All data entities and relationships reflect the diagram structure and relational schema.
